This section shows some of the projects I have done as a result of my learning process or hobby.

## Machine Learning

***

- Pandemic Board Game

An alternative implementation of Pandemic Board Game through the develop of artificial intelligence agents who model the standard play of an average user.

- Multi-agent system examples

Using Jason framework for the development of multi-agent systems.

- Fish bank simulation

Using Java to model a 2D simulation of a fish bank autonomous behaviour environment.

- Agents Communication

Using Jade to develop a simple comunication between autonomous agents.

- Artificial Inmune System (AIS) Development

Implementing an artificial immune system (AIS) to solve the N Queen Problem.

- K-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict a car's market price

In this project, we'll use some of the machine learning techniques to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The chosen technique will be k-nearest neighbors algorithm developed in its univariate and multivariate models. Afterwards, another part related to the optimization of the best model obtained is executed. To do this, we'll make use of grid search techniques.

- Linear regression model to predict House Sale Prices in the market

For this project, we'll see how to develop the machine learning approach with a linear regression model for predicting house sale prices at the same time as we understand different techniques of feature selection and feature engineering to accomplish a good model fitting. Some of these techniques include cleaning, transforming, and selecting appropiate features.

- Linear regression model to predict future prices in the stock market

Inside this project a simple linear regression model is developed to extract information in the stock market and use it to predict next prices in it.

- Linear regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict bike renting in a communal bike sharing station

For this project, we'll see how to develop a linear regression model, a decision tree model and a random forest model to predict the number of people renting bikes at a communal bike sharing station located in Washington D.C., US. We'll evaluate every model and define what it is the one that best fits the data and gets the best overall results.
