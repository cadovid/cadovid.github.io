This section shows some of the projects I have done as a result of my learning process or hobby. All these exercises are for purely educational purposes.

## Probability and Statistics

***

<br>

1. **Statistical analysis of Fandango's site movie ratings**

    Fandango displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars. Here we complete a statistical analysis of the site using available Python tools.

2. **Statistical analysis of the best markets to advertise in for an e-learning platform**

    In this project a statistical analysis is provided over the data from freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey. The site freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. The goals are to identify the best country markets to advertise in for a new e-learning platform using Python.

3. **Calculation of probabilities of winning the lottery**

    In this project, we are going to contribute to the development of a mobile app by writing a couple of functions that are mostly focused on calculating probabilities to help users know the real possibilities of winning the lottery.

4. **Building a mobile spam filter with the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm**

    In this project we are going to teach the machine how to classify messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. To accomplish this, we are going to take advantage of Bayes' Theorem and other probability resources.

5. **Analyzing Jeopardy! TV show game using statistical techniques as Chi-Squared test or hypothesis testing**

    In this project, we'll use a dataset to identify the knowledge from past questions that can boost us to find any edge we can get to win the game. For this task, we'll use different statistical techniques as Chi-Squared tests or hypothesis testing through Python language.
