This section shows some of the projects I have done as a result of my learning process or hobby.

## Algorithm complexity

***

- Building fast queries for a database

In this project, the implementation of different algorithms that allow queries to be performed on a database is carried out by means of OOP. At the same time, time complexity is analysed and alternative ways of improving these algorithms and making them more time efficient are sought.
