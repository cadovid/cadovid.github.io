<center>Hi there! I am <b>David</b>.</center>

Hello and welcome to my little space!

I am a research-oriented professional in the area of artificial intelligence. With a solid background in the fields of mathematics and engineering, I like to approach this new field with a complete theoretical and practical approach.

Currently, I work as a machine learning researcher and engineer at The Mindkind S.L, where we explore new ideas that enable the development of autonomous bots with human-like behaviour.

I am an enthusiast of continuous learning, and both discovering and exploring new solutions is part of my daily life.

I have experience in teamwork and international environments, so I am always ready to face a new challenge.

See you around!
